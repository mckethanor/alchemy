defmodule Alchemy.Events do
  @moduledoc """
  This module provides raw Event hooks into the various events supplied by
  the gateway.

  To use the macros in this module, it must be `used`. This also defines
  a `__using__` macro for that module, which will then allow those hooks
  to be loaded in the main application via `use`.
  ### Example Usage

  ```elixir
  defmodule Example do
    use Alchemy.Events

    Events.on_message(:inspect)
    def inspect(message) do
      IO.inspect message.content
    end
  end

  defmodule Application do
    use Application
    alias Alchemy.Client

    def start(_type, _args) do
      run = Client.start(@token)
      use Example
      run
    end

  end
  ```

  require Logger
  alias Alchemy.Cogs.EventHandler
  require Alchemy.EventMacros
  import Alchemy.EventMacros

  @doc """
  Unloads all the hooks in a module from the handler.

  If you just want to disable a single function from triggering,
  see `Events.disable/1`.
  ## Examples
  ```elixir
  Client.start(@token)
  use MyEvents
  ```
  If we want to remove this hooks at any point, we can simply do
  ```elixir
  Events.unload(MyEvents)
  ```
  And, to set hook the module back up, all we need to do is:
  ```elixir
  use MyEvents
  ```
  """
  @spec unload(atom) :: :ok
  def unload(module) do
    EventHandler.unload(module)
    Logger.info("*#{inspect(module)}* removed from the event handler")
  end

  @doc """
  Unhooks a function from the event handler.

  If you want to unhook all the functions in a module, see `Events.unload/1`.
  Because you can have multiple hooks with the same name, this function takes
  both the module and the function name.

  ## Examples
  ```elixir
  defmodule Annoying do
    use Alchemy.Events

    Events.on_message(:inspect)
    def inspect(message), do: IO.inspect message.content
  end
  ```
  This function is annoying us, so we can easily disable it:
  ```elixir
  Events.disable(Annoying, :inspect)
  ```
  If we want to turn it back on, we can of course do
  ```elixir
  use Annoying
  ```
  """
  @spec disable(atom, atom) :: :ok

    EventHandler.disable(module, function)

  Registers a handle triggering whenever a channel gets created.

  `args` : `Alchemy.Channel.t`

  As opposed to `on_DMChannel_create`, this gets triggered when a channel gets
  created in a guild, and not when a user starts a DM with this client.
